you can use crypto.py wihout .exe file 

python encryption_script.py -k my_secret_key encrypt -f input_file.txt -o output_file.psf

python encryption_script.py -k my_secret_key decrypt -f encrypted_file.psf -o decrypted_file.txt

#auto output file (.psf)
python encryption_script.py -k my_secret_key encrypt -f input_file.txt

  if you use a file with the .exe extension
  this will make it easier for you to use the program works only on windows
